# ConnectLife
This mobile app is a clone of an app I made in connection to company Gorenje, but because of their policy I can't upload the original project, because of some sensitive data. The original mobile app enables the user to turn on/off and select different parameters for kitchen appliances like an oven, fridge and washing machine. This app does all the same things just visually without actually communicating with any appliances.

## Installation
* Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/lenartgolob/ConnectLife-Mobile-App.git`
* Install all the required dependecies `npm install`
* Run the project `npm start`

## Functionality
The original app worked with a testing account and a testing oven, fridge and washing machine that I was able to use for educational purposes and was given to me by company Gorenje.

### Induction page
Users selects the plate and selects the wanted temperature. *This page wasn't functional in the original app, beacuse of the laws that don't allow open appliances to be tempered with remotely.* <br/>
